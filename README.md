Your work is going to fall a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you live is great work. And the only way to great work is to love what you do. If you haven`t found it yet. keep looking and don't settle. â€‹

As with all matters of the hearts, you'll know when you find it, And like any great relationship. it just gets better and better ad the years roll on, so keep looking, don't settle.
